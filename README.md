# key-menu.nvim

**ðŸš§ This plugin is currently in a beta state. It is usable and I use it as part of my normal, everyday config. But many features are missing and there may be bugs. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome! ðŸš§**

## Highlights

- Just works. Lightweight and simple. Minimal configuration.
- Hint window pops up next to your cursor, and uses as little screen real estate as possible.
- No custom syntax for creating mappings â€“ just use Neovim's standard, built-in `vim.keymap.set`.
